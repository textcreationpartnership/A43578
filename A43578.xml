            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If any value is to be put on my poor Judgment; I do aſſure thee I eſteem it a choice Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

            <p>Amongſt the variety of good Books, which through divine indulgence are yet to be bought; it will be thy wiſdome to buy thoſe that are of general uſe, and ſuch is this Book, I commend to thee; Buy it, read it oft, meditate on it ſeriouſly, and
<pb facs="tcp:102353:4"/>lift up thy heart to God for his bleſſing, and thou wilt finde much cauſe to admire his good Providence in handing this Book to thee, and wilt bee incited to do that work, many Profeſſors are too remiſs in, <hi>viz.</hi> The getting an Heart treaſure, which will greatly ſupport thee under preſent and future tryal.</p>
            <p>In the Appendix thou wilt meet with excellent helps for the diſcharge of the neceſſary and much neglected duty of Meditation, whereby thou maieſt get much Treaſure for holy thoughts, and ſo prevent that, which is the burthen of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious ſouls, <hi>viz.</hi> vain thoughts, and be fitted for Duty, and enjoy much of Heaven on Earth.</p>

            <p>Concerning the birth and bulk of this Treatiſe I muſt tell you, that the occaſion of it was this: I heard a godly Miniſter preach a Sermon upon this Text, and I was much affected with it. and reſolved when I came home to ſearch into it, I ſtudied and preached three Sermons (as I remember) upon it, with which ſome were ſo offected, that ſeveral intreated me to give them Copies thereof, which I ſet my ſelf to; but as I writ it, it ſwelled in my hands to this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at loſt; and when ſome had peruſed it, they entreated me to let it be printed, and ſome would be at the charges; it was a ſudden, and (to me) a ſtrange motion, for I never yet judged any labours of mine to be of ſo much worth as to be expoſed to publick view, yet I did not know what hand and end, the Lord might have in this motion: I ſought God about it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſearch my heart, and purge it from the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of vanity and oſtentation, which (God knows) I found too much working in me; then I told my Friend I would communicate it to ſome Reverend Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and ſhould be ruled by their judgment, and and advice: I did ſo, and four or five eminent men in theſe two Counties of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> have moved me to publiſh it; and if Providence clears its way, I am freely content, the Lord do with me and it, as ſeems good in his eyes:</p>
            <p>The Subject I am ſure, is of great importance, nor have lever ſeen any Treatiſe of this nature; if it were
<pb facs="tcp:102353:7"/>profitably handled it might be of ſingular uſe: what is of man. I hope God will pity and pardon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Instrument; and what proceedeth from his bleſſed Spirit, may through the help of the Spirit reach and teach the ſpirit, as this hath been (in a ſort) painful, ſo hath it been very pleaſant and delightful to me: and this I can ſay, I never found variety of matter ſo flowing into my mind at any time, as in writing this Book I have experienced: if the Lord do good by it, I have my end.</p>

A third ſpring that feeds holy thoughts is wel-gathered experiences: the Chriſtians breaſt is to be a treaſury of experimental ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, which may be improved as good props to uphold a tottering Faith.

Time would

O Chriſtians! lay up in your hearts, what you have ſeen with your eyes, and felt in your ſouls, of the vanity of worldly, and the excellency of Heavenly attainments, and enjoyments: You cannot be too young to collect experiences; you cannot be too old to recollect and improve them: If your green heads would uſe diligence,

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102353:20"/>heart ſtruck dead with a ſudden ſurprizal, ſo that the thoughts are puzzelled, Experience comes in to their relief, and repreſents the ſtate as feaſible, ſince it calls to minde as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous a caſe, which yet was not inſuperable; And why maiſt thou not get through as wel as formerly, ſaith Experience?

<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26</note> the Spirit can help both to affections and expreſſions. A treaſured ſoul hath a ſtock of prayers, as an able Miniſter hath a ſtock for Sermons (though he may be without a ſtock of written notes;) I mean, the body of Divinity in his head; which makes a ready Scribe: The more treaſure a ſoul hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the more ready will it bee to every good work; yea, and the more raiſed to God in the work: Such a one is help'd very much againſt Diſtractions, the great complaint of good ſouls.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.1 Col. 3.16 Eph. 5.19</note> the tongue will be as the pen of a ready Writer; If the heart be filled with Grace, it will make melody to the Lord, and muſick to Good men. A treaſured Soul is ready to trade with God in Duty. Yet take this Caution: A true Chriſtian having a large meaſure of habitual Grace, is not alwaies in an equal actual capacity for Duty: <hi>David</hi>'s heart may need tuning as wel as his Harp. The key of this treaſure may be loſt or ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So that the treaſure of that man after Gods own heart, was lock'd up in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for the ſpace of nine months, til God ſent the key by <hi>Nathan</hi> to open the Sluce of Repentance, and draw out the Seeds of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Treaſure in the heart is alſo drawn out with the hands, in the works of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, charity to men, and ſobriety with reſpect to our ſelves: So the Apoſtle diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.

Here is a large field of matter for my pen, and the Chriſtians hand; but the furniſhed Chriſtian is univerſal
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102353:24"/>in Obedience, baulks not the hardeſt and moſt hazardous Duties; will not ſerve God with that which coſts him nothing: And this is a grand diſcriminating note betwixt a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Saint, and a treaſureleſs Hypocrite: The carnal perſon loves a cheap Religion, and is loath to bee at any coſt or pains for God, in a way of commanded Duty; but to a Childe of God the more ſpiritual a Duty is, and the more oppoſite 'tis to carnal eaſe and profit, the more freely doth the ſoul cloſe with it: He is willing to cut off a right hand of a beloved Luſt, pray for enemies, forgive wrongs, give to the poor; as knowing that all theſe (yea,

For obſerve it, this is the nature of Goſpel-diſpenſations; What ſpiritual good things the Saints receive, they have them not now from God as Creator, ſo much as through the hands of Jeſus Chriſt as the great Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new Covenant, he is the Channel or Ciſtern, or rather Fountain of all Grace, that our ſouls expect or receive: Hee is our <hi>Aaron</hi> annointed above his fellows, that the Oyle of Grace might in its proportion fall from the head to the Members. Hence it is that he is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and we <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> from this holy unction: For this end was our Lord Jeſus advanced to be the head of the Church, that he might fill it with all gracious ſupplies: and hence it is, that the Church is called <hi>his Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all,</hi> Eph. 1.23. <hi>i. e.</hi> the effect of Chriſts fulneſs, who filleth all the Saints, in all Ordinances and means of conveyance of gracious Influences: Truth of Grace is from him, growth and ſtrength of Grace are from him; both the leaſt meaſure and a large treaſure are to be had in him; <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. <hi>I came that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. i. e.</hi> the Eſſence and Abundance are both from him. So then we ſee Chriſt is deſigned to bee

We cannot but know all the wickedneſs that our hearts are privy to, and cannot our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſcover an emptineſs &amp; vacuity of good? Oh what a Chaos and confuſion is in our hearts! and whence comes this? Have we not had meanes of gathering a large treaſure? What have we done with all our Ordinances, Sermons, Sacraments, Mercies, Afflictions? If we had been diligent, we might have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed our ſoules with truths, graces, comforts, and experiences: What could have been done more for us? And have we a treaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to our enjoyments? whence then are we ſo unfit for, and untoward in duties? ſo flight, dead, and trifling in performances? ſo unprepared for, and unprofitable under Ordinances? ſo unthankful for mercies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented under croſſes? ſo weak in reſiſting temptations, ſubduing corruptions? ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing of, and unſuitable to communion of Saints? Oh whence is it, that we are ſo

               <p>I ſhall propound theſe four conſiderations, briefly for the Saints conviction and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 1. Are not theſe ſpiritual things worth hoarding up? look about you, through the whole Creation, and ſee if you can finde any thing better to make a treaſure of; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfection, Pſal.</hi> 119.96.

               <p>To begin with the firſt, which is this: What courſe ſhall a Chriſtian take to hoard up a treaſure of holy thoughts? This is the <hi>good treaſure</hi> chiefly intended in the Text, and I ſhal be the larger upon this Head. To this end I ſhal propound theſe ten Directions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Work upon your hearts the reality &amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the things of God: get throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that there are ſuch things to be had, &amp; that they are worth laying up; You muſt look
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102353:69"/>upon Divine things as infallibly certain, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably excellent: thoſe were accounted ſenſual and bruitiſh Philoſophers, that (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Epicurus</hi>) placed mans chief happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in matters of ſenſe, as profit, pleaſure, honour—But thoſe were the moſt ſublime, and (in aſort) Divine, that placed the (<hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> or) chief good, in what is above, or oppoſite to ſenſe, as in the good things of the minde, and moral vertue; Can Heathens by the light of nature and reaſon ſee a reality &amp; excellency in things inviſible to ſenſe, &amp; ſhal not Chriſtians much more? it is a ſhame for a Saint, inlightned by the Spirit, to be ſo <hi>blear-eyed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.10.</note> as not to ſee afar off, or view ſpiritual objects:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.</note> 'tis the duty and property of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to over-look things that are ſeen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently to behold things not ſeen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. O Sirs, could you as really ſee with a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eye ſpiritual goods, as you can with your natural eyes behold corporal objects, what an advantage would it be to you? Could you make Goſpel-myſteries, and mercies as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual to your ſelves, as a rich mans Bags and Lands are to him, what an exceeding help would it be? This made <hi>Moſes</hi> forſake the viſible glory of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and endure intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things in the Wilderneſſe, for he ſaw him that was inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. Thus Chriſtians are to realize Divine Things, and account highly of them, for no man will treaſure up that which he accounts not as moſt excellent, the making light of Goſpel-grace, is the great reaſon why ſo many go
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102353:69"/>without it, ſo 'tis ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.5. the bidden gueſts made light of it,<note place="margin">

               <p>THere remains yet another part of this Directorie. How a good Man is to bring forth good things out of the good treaſure of the heart: in the Explication, this hath been largelie inſiſted upon, that a Chriſtian muſt lay out, and make uſe of his treaſure in the great duties of meditation, religious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, ſpiritual conferences, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and enduring much for God: no more of them: I ſhal onlie add ſomething of the manner of improving this treaſure, in the fore-mentioned duties.</p>
               <p>A Chriſtians treaſure muſt be drawn out—

The Chriſtian is to bring forth things new, as wel as old; latelie obtained, as wel as long ſince hoarded: you are to improve truths at the firſt rebound: many good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, conceptions, impreſſions are loſt for want of ſpeedie uſe; and many ſouls are undone by neglect and delay: <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.27.

Alas, ſaith one, I fear I have no ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as here is deſcribed, for I have a very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant head, and therfore an empty heart, theſe treaſures enter in by the door and window of knowledge, but I know nothing yet as I ought to know; I canot conceive aright of one truth, &amp; how I ſhould I then have a treaſure of truths?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 'Tis well thou art complaining; Unſanctified knowledge puffeth up with conceits of imaginary attainments, gracious ſouls are ſenſible of defects and lament their ignorance: <hi>David</hi> was a Saint wel-treaſured, yet cals himſelf <hi>a beaſt; Agur</hi> was a wiſe and holy man, yet profeſſeth that hee was more bruitiſh than any man: nay, he ſaith, <hi>he had not the underſtanding of a man,</hi> Pro. 30.2. 'Tis an hopeful ſign to hear Chriſtians bewail their ignorance, but it doth not become any man to brag of his Knowledge: the loweſt humility is the higheſt attainment: ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial is a ſign of, and means to ſpiritual Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: 'tis a ſign thou haſt profited when thou diſcerneſt and bewaileſt thy non-proficiency: Beſides, you muſt know, that you are not to determine of your treaſure of truths, by the number of truths known, but by the manner of your knowing them, and your eſtimation of them; do you value the truth ſo, as to buy the truth at any rate, and to ſell it at no rate? nay, are you not willing to part with your lives rather than truth? Hath not truth had efficacy in your hearts, authority over your conſciences, and prevalency in your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations? Do you give up your ſelves to the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102353:144"/>truths you do know? and, walk with God according to light received? if ſo, then you have a treaſure both of truths and graces: 'tis a wonder to conſider how little light, and how much heat Chriſts own Diſciples, and zealous Martyrs have gone ſtraight to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with: I ſpeak not this to ſooth up any in ignorance, or to patronize negligence, but to quiet the poor doubting diſconſolate conſcience, that's affected with a ſenſe of its ignorance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ah, ſaith another, Is it poſſible that I ſhould have a treaſure of grace that have ſuch a treaſure of ſin; the Lord knows, my heart is even ſtuffed full of corruption, there is ſuch a huge fardel on my back, ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous body of death, that I much fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have any grace at all in my heart or no, my ſin bears me down like a violent torrent, luſt is predominant, and can grace be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I am glad to hear theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from thee, it is no new thing for a <hi>Paul</hi> to cry out of <hi>a body of death:</hi> living men feel the weight of a burden, but dead men are not hurt: Doſt thou really complain of the power of ſin! then 'tis a Tyrant, not a King in thy heart? Doſt thou ſigh and fight againſt ſin?<note place="margin">Deut. 22.25.</note> bleſſe God for that Light to ſee it, and Life to oppoſe it: the <hi>forced Damſel</hi> cleared her innocency by crying out, ſo doth the vanquiſhed ſoul evidence integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity by zealous groans to God; 'tis but a Rape not a compleat Conqueſt, while the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102353:145"/>ſoul is ſtrugling with its enemy, and gives not up the Fort of the heart: But know this, that a Chriſtian may have a large treaſure of grace in his heart, and yet feel violent workings of luſt, grace may be ſtrong, yet corruption im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous; God may give it a commiſſion to make violent incurſions upon the wel-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſoul, for wiſe and gracious ends: only conſider whether thy prayers be ardent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts vehement, and mournings for it bitter and more than ordinary; if it be thus with thee, thou mayſt have a treaſure for all that, not only a principle of grace, but a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof, for oppoſites illuſtrate one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and though there be ſtrong luſtings of the fleſh againſt the Spirit, yet if there be alſo proportionable ſtruglings of the Spirit againſt the fleſh, the ſouls condition may be ſafe, and for ought I know, it may be rich in Grace; That's for the ſecond Object.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But, ſaith the Chriſtian, you talk much of a treaſure of comforts, but alas I know not what that means, alas comfort is far away; ſurely if I had had any grace I ſhould have had peace, but I have been long under ſadneſs and in many diſconſolate fears, I fear I have no treaſure of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Grace and Peace are not inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they may be diſ-joined, as Scripture and Experience teſtifie, many a gracious ſoul hath been in deep ſorrows, a ſoul may have a Hell within it, and yet at laſt go to Heaven; a Chriſtian may ſail thorow a tempeſtuous Sea to a quiet Haven; Yea, further obſerve,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:102353:145"/>that a Chriſtian may have a treaſure of grace, yet want a treaſure of joy and comfort; the reaſon is, becauſe comfort is an effect of Gods Spirit, which acts arbitrarily, and not by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, for if the Spirit ſhine not upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit in the ſoul, it ſhal have no comfort, though it be full of grace; Now God doth ſometimes ſuſpend the comforting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Spirit from the beſt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for righteous and gracious ends: hence we finde eminent ſervants of God (that feared God above many) complaining of the want of comfort, as <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Heman;</hi> yea, ſometimes we finde our dear Redeemer (who had a treaſure of grace, and the Spirit above meaſure) complaining of Gods forſaking him, and conſequently of the abſence of joy and comfort: Poor ſoul, do not murmure that God doth not alwayes feed thee with theſe Sweet-meats, which are are the fare of the Upper-Table, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for an heavenly Banquet: what though thou haſt not always actual poſſeſſion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yet thou haſt a ſolid Foundation for it: what if thou be not continually dandled on thy Fathers lap, and kiſſed with the kiſſes of his mouth, yet thou art a childe ſtil, and thou canſt not deny but ſometimes he doth viſit thy ſoul with heart-ſolacing conſolations, and thou mighteſt have a treaſure of them if thou couldeſt be ready for them, or rightly improve them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Alas, ſaith the troubled heart, if I knew my ſtate were ſafe, I could be better ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102353:146"/>in the want of comfort, but I have cauſe to cal all into queſtion, I have been ſo barren and unprofitable under meanes of grace, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and providences, I may crie out my leanneſs, my leanneſs, woe unto me, if there had been any real good in my ſoul, it would have been more increaſed under my long-enjoyed helps.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, there is never a ſoul under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but hath ſad cauſe to complain under ordinances and enjoyments; where is the man that can ſtand forth, and ſay he hath gathered in harveſt as much as he might have done? but there is a profiting to grace, and in grace, haſt thou experiences of the former? haſt thou been waſted over by the boat of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances into Jeſus Chriſt, unto a ſtate of grace, I hope thou canſt not denie this; wel then, thou haſt attained to the main proficiencie, bleſs God for that, and for a progreſs in grace, examine thy ſelf a little more ſtrictlie, is not Jeſus Chriſt more endeared to thee? do not the things of God reliſh better with thee? doſt thou not more ſcorn the World, and all preferments that it offers to thee? is not thy prevailing purpoſe to cleave to God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding oppoſitions, more fixed and ſetled in thy heart, upon long experience of the waies of God? doſt thou not every day ſee more demonſtrative reaſons to confirm thee in thy choice of this better part? and let me ask thee, whether thou haſt not grown down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in humilitie, ſelf-denial, hatred of ſin, love to the Saints? though thou canſt not
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102353:146"/>ſay thou haſt grown upwards in joy, faith, heavenly-mindedneſs, and communion with God? do not think thou art above complaint and proficiencie in this life; none have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a perfect treaſure in this vally of teares, and ſhadow of death; you wil have cauſe to complain of defects and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which in your perfect Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſs, your God wil graciouſlie cover and cure.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>I anſwer, thou haſt cauſe to lament thy non-proficiencie, and bewaile that thou haſt not kept pace with others, there ſhould be an holie emulation amongſt Chriſtians, and a ſtriving which ſhal be richeſt in theſe good things of Heaven; but withal, comparing your ſelves with others, is no good rule, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to ſhame your negligent hearts, and excite diligent endeavours) becauſe ſome have better parts, and may ſooner attaine to higher degrees of knowledge, and ſome God intends to cal out to extraordinarie ſervice or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, others God deſigns to pluck away ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by death, and ſo layes up much in a ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time.— Beſides, though they may ſeem to

            <head>An APPENDIX Concerning Meditation, with ſome helps to furniſh the thoughts with ſuitable and profitable Subjects.</head>
            <p>THat the vacant pages may be ſupplyed, it wil not be impertinent here to annex a Specimen or Example, to help the working thoughts, in the great duty of Meditation, yet here I ſhal not undertake to handle the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place of Meditation, which you may finde inſiſted upon, purpoſely by Mr. <hi>Fenner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his <hi>Saints Reſt,</hi> and many others, and abundant examples thereof in thoſe incomparable works of that reverend contemplative Divine, Dr. <hi>Hall;</hi> But what I ſhal do on this behalf, is only to purſue the deſign of the foregoing Treatiſe, in preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome conſiderations, to help the Chriſtian to a treaſure of good thoughts, that he may not want any matter of Meditation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is: before I proceed to the examples, I ſhal ſpeak a few words concerning thoughts, and good thoughts, and deliberate good thoughts in the duty of Meditation.</p>
            <p>Thoughts in general (according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) are the internal acts of the ſoul, of

            <p>Now my deſign is to furniſh and rectifie theſe internal operations of the heart, and to help the ſoul with ſuch ſubjects and objects as may finde it profitable work when it hath no creature to converſe with, that the thoughts may be holy, ſweet, ſavoury, and heavenly; Now there are four qualifications eſſentially requiſite to the conſtitution of good thoughts. 1. They muſt be materially good, not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about ſinful or trifling things, that do either prejudice, or not at all profit the ſoul, but exerciſed in ſome ſpiritual, ſuitable meditations about God, Chriſt, the Word, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> what may tend to edification. 2. They muſt be <hi>formally good, i. e.</hi> regulated by the Word of God, as the Rule thereof, to ſquare and order the thoughts, both for Principle, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and End. 3. They muſt be ſeaſonably good every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon: a thing may be good in its own nature, yet not good as to thoſe circumſtances of time and other reſpects wherwith it may be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 4. They muſt be eventually good, as to the fruit, effect, impreſſion of theſe thoughts, he that thinks, ſhould aim at Gods glory and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102353:157"/>his own ſouls good; and the fruit of the thought muſt be good, tending to quicken or ſtrengthen ſome grace, kill and crucifie ſome luſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="1">1. Let your thoughts inſiſt upon the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, eternal and incomprehenſible Majeſty of God, here you may ſoon loſe your ſelves in the vaſt Ocean of his bleſſed eſſence, yet lanch not too far, but bound your thoughts by the ſure Card of Scripture-diſcovery; thus think, 1. Oh what an holy omniſcient, omni preſent Spirit is the Almighty maker and poſſeſſor of heaven and earth! What tranſcendent myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are lockt up in the Trinitie of Perſons in the unitie of Eſſence! how impoſſible is it for a mortal eye to approach that inacceſſible Light! <hi>none can ſee God and live,</hi> yet have poor ſinners a glorious reflection of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in the Perſon of our dear Redeemer, and in his ſweet proclaiming his bleſſed Name, and diſplaying his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes

            <p n="2">2. Fix your thoughts upon the works of Creation, ſtudy this large voluminous Book, every page thereof will finde you freſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of meditation and admiration: every creature hath a tongue to tell us of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdome of its Maker: and thus let your thoughts be working; ſurely this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fabrick of Heaven and Earth ſpeaks aloud the glory of the great Creator; if this vaſt Globe of the Earth be above twenty thouſand miles in compaſſe, then what a vaſt extent are the Heavens of? which are ſtretched out as a Curtain; how admirably hath God laid the beams of his Chambers in the waters, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:102353:158"/>hanged the earth upon nothing? how firmly hath God builded his ſtories in the Heaven, and fixed the glorious Conſtellations as foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Light? oh what beauty is there in the <hi>Father of Lights</hi> that hath ſet up reſplendent Luminaries? theſe great bodies were created of nothing by the word of Gods power, and yet there is deep myſteries in the leaſt and loweſt creature, every Herb, Flower, Plant, ſpire of graſs, Twig and Leaf, Worm or Fly, Scale or Feather, Billow or Meteor, hath enough in it to puzzle the moſt profound Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and ſpeaks the power and wiſdome of our great Creator: how much more the curious piece of mans Bodie? <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> but much more may I ſtand admiring the ſtrange nature of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul: and ſtill reflect with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and admiration upon the power and goodneſſe of my omnipotent Creator.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

Soar aloft my ſoul, and mind things above, debaſe not thy noble nature with purſuit of things that are below thy ſelf: get well adorned with the graces of the Spirit, and enriched with an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, make God thy portion, lay up laſting treaſures in Heaven, and then return unto thy Reſt, and God will deal bountifully with thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

Oh the Antiquity, Authority, Excellency and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, Power and Purity, Perfection and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, verity and perpetuity of the ſacred Bible! Methinks when I take up this holie Book, I take wonders into my hands, and when I look within it I meet with Myſteries, that the wiſdome of the greateſt Clarks can never reach, and yet the meaneſt capacity by the help of that Spirit which indited them, may wade this deep foard of divine ſecrets: how plainly held forth therein are neceſſary truths and duties that lead the ſoul to God and eternal happineſs! How familiarly and affectionately doth God converſe with man therein? how pat and proper to my ſtate are the precious Promiſes in theſe bleſſed pages? every word hath its weight, and comes as pertinently as if the Lord had named me; methinks, there's no ſuch vertue or ſavour in any other Writings, what reviving doth it bring into my heart! O bleſſed be God for the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let your thoughts be employed about the glorious works of Providence: oh how ſweet are they? who ſo is wiſe will conſider them: pauſe after this manner, O my ſoul, take a view of this beautiful Checker-work of divine Providence; conſider the days of old, and the years of many generations, recollect what the Scripture records, of drying up the <hi>Sea, driving back Jordan,</hi> the <hi>ſtanding still,</hi> and <hi>going back of the Sun in the Firmament,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102353:160"/>upon the miracles of Mercie for the Church, and of judgment upon the Enemies: nay, conſider O my ſoul what wonders God hath wrought in thy daies, in thine eies: Oh what national, domeſtical, perſonal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances haſt thou ſeen? even ſuch as may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and ſilence Unbelief for ever: thou needeſt not want matter of holy muſing, if thou take a ſtrict ſurvey of the courſe of thy life, and particular providences about thy Soul, Body, Eſtate, Name, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all thy Concernments, which may afford a vaſt Field of devout Meditation: thoſe waies of Providence that ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and unlovely whilſt ſeen but in their birth and parts, how comely now are they in their mature product and perfection? I ſaw not then, but I have fully ſeen ſince what the Lord aimed at in his ſtrange Diſpenſations: Oh the happy compoſure, ſymmetrie, and contexture of all things, conſpiring together by the concurrence of Providence to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, and to center in the grand end of all things, viz. <hi>the glory of God.</hi> How wonderful are his <hi>Judgments, and his wayes paſt finding out?</hi>

            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like Occurrences muſt put you in mind of ſuch meditations, and thus may your thoughts both have, and be a bleſſed Treaſure.</p>
            <p>I ſhal now conclude all with a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations to move us all, thus to employ our thoughts upon profitable Subjects:</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Holie thoughts are proper fruits of a ſanctified mind: none ſees the thoughts but God, a good heart approves it ſelf to the ſearcher of hearts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Holy thoughts help againſt Satans temptations: theſe are as cool water to

            <p n="7">7. This is the higheſt excellency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our Spirits: it is the nobleſt employment of the ſoul, and advancement of its faculties: the ſoul is of an high birth, its a debaſing of it to mind low things: the Saints are of an high and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous extract by their ſecond birth, muſt and wil mind the things of Heaven, in all things beſides excelling others, in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling themſelves, as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Buchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer.</hi>
